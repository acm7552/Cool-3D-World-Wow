IGME-219 FinalProject

Group Project- Designing and creating a game level in Maya and Unity.

Milestone 1 will expect:

A collection of at least fifteen images that represents what your project will look like when it is done.
    This can be an original work if you would like, or it can be a collection of concept and other images pulled from the web that help articulate how you  will build up your environment.
    The images must be in a zipped folder, submitted to the mycourses dropbox in the appropriate folder.
    Good places to find reference include sites like http://www.conceptroot.com/ and conceptart.org
A written plan of work showing how you will move forward on the project. This must include the things listed below. 
    Complete asset list of all models you are planning to have in your scene
    A breakdown of who will do what on the project (this will likely change as you get into production, but having an idea at the beginning will help)
    Method of communication: text, email, facebook, slack, groupme, etc,
    Method of task handling and file storing: google drive, favro, dropbox, github, trello
    List the people in your group
    How you are planning to keep it uniform: style, naming, format, size/units. What are they?
    What to do when someone is not pulling their weight - problems with the group - how do you handle it?
    Did you overscope? Can you complete everything by the deadline? Is this worthy of a final project?
    Schedules with deadlines, what is expected when?    
    Expectations - What is your goal for the final project? What is the end result, what do you hope to accomplish?
    What makes your project different - how is your project unique?
    What is animated? How?
    Additional components: particles, lighting, programming, functionality, etc

Everyone in your group should have had some input on the direction of the concept. Making your description thorough now will make your team much better off in the long run. Make certain that everyone in the group shares the same vision for what this environment will be when you are finished.

You will also graybox your level in Unity.

For the graybox, use primitive objects inside of Unity to construct your environments. Textures and models are not necessary yet. Make sure you get input from your whole team on issues of scale, proportion, and placement.

Create a scene in Unity that contains a collection of primitives that reflects your proposed layout. Deliberately design spaces that are interesting to walk around in. Add landmarks that guide the player to other interesting areas.
    Represent all of the walkable space, obstructing walls, separate spaces, and important objects and props in the scene.
        Objects and props can be represented by primitives (cubes, spheres, etc.) for now.
Include a first-person character controller so that you can walk around in the space that you have created.
No textures or models are required yet.
    If you do have models or textures made this might set you ahead on the next milestone.
    Feel free to import any assets that you have already made for the class.
    Be sure to work with your team to address issues of scale and object placement.
